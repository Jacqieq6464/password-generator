# password-generator
Using Java Script to create a password generator
## Approach:
        * Create pseudo code to map requirements and functions.
        * Create variables to cover the scope of the characters that would be used to generate a random password. 
        * Create a for loop to allow the selection of the characters from the array.
        * Create prompt to establish desired password length:
            - password length must be more than 8 characters and less than 128 characters.
        * Create prompt & alerts to establish & notify the user which characters they would like to use
            - character options are:
                Upper Case
                Lower Case
                Numbers
                Symbols
        * Create alert to notify user if password is less than 8 or more than 128 characters
        * Create an alert if the user users an invalid entry for password length
        *
